-- The Sheet explained
The Sheet is a set of rows and columns. It forms the same pattern as we have in math exercise books, the rectangle boxes formed by the pattern are called cells.

-- Note: You can also select the entire spreadsheet by pressing Ctrl+A for Windows, or Cmd+A for MacOS.

-- There are two ways to select a range of cells

Name Box
Drag to mark a range.

-- Filling
Filling makes your life easier and is used to fill ranges with values, so that you do not have to type manual entries.

-- Filling can be used for:

Copying
Sequences
Dates
Functions (*)

-- Fill Sequences
Filling can be used to create sequences. A sequence is an order or a pattern. We can use the filling function to continue the order that has been set.

-- Sequences can for example be used on numbers and dates.

-- The difference between cutting and copying, is that cutting removes the originals, while copying leaves the originals.

-- Adding New Rows
Rows can also be added and deleted. You access the menu by right clicking the row number. New rows are added to the same place you clicked.

-- The total is called SUM in Excel.

There are two ways to calculate the SUM.

Adding cells

-- Relative and Absolute References

Excel has two types of references:

Relative references
Absolute references

Absolute reference is a choice we make. It is a command which tells Excel to lock a reference.

The dollar sign ($) is used to make references absolute.

Example of relative reference: A1

Example of absolute reference: $A$1
The dollar sign has three different states:

Absolute for column and row. The reference is absolutely locked.
Example =$A$1

Absolute for the column. The reference is locked to that column. The row remains relative.
Example =$A1

Absolute for the row. The reference is locked to that row. The column remains relative.
Example =A$1
