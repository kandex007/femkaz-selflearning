-- The Sheet explained
The Sheet is a set of rows and columns. It forms the same pattern as we have in math exercise books, the rectangle boxes formed by the pattern are called cells.

-- Note: You can also select the entire spreadsheet by pressing Ctrl+A for Windows, or Cmd+A for MacOS.

-- There are two ways to select a range of cells

Name Box
Drag to mark a range.

-- Filling
Filling makes your life easier and is used to fill ranges with values, so that you do not have to type manual entries.

-- Filling can be used for:

Copying
Sequences
Dates
Functions (*)

-- Fill Sequences
Filling can be used to create sequences. A sequence is an order or a pattern. We can use the filling function to continue the order that has been set.

-- Sequences can for example be used on numbers and dates.

-- The difference between cutting and copying, is that cutting removes the originals, while copying leaves the originals.

-- Adding New Rows
Rows can also be added and deleted. You access the menu by right clicking the row number. New rows are added to the same place you clicked.
