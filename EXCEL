-- The Sheet explained
The Sheet is a set of rows and columns. It forms the same pattern as we have in math exercise books, the rectangle boxes formed by the pattern are called cells.

-- Note: You can also select the entire spreadsheet by pressing Ctrl+A for Windows, or Cmd+A for MacOS.

-- There are two ways to select a range of cells

Name Box
Drag to mark a range.

-- Filling
Filling makes your life easier and is used to fill ranges with values, so that you do not have to type manual entries.

-- Filling can be used for:

Copying
Sequences
Dates
Functions (*)

-- Fill Sequences
Filling can be used to create sequences. A sequence is an order or a pattern. We can use the filling function to continue the order that has been set.

-- Sequences can for example be used on numbers and dates.

-- The difference between cutting and copying, is that cutting removes the originals, while copying leaves the originals.

-- Adding New Rows
Rows can also be added and deleted. You access the menu by right clicking the row number. New rows are added to the same place you clicked.

-- The total is called SUM in Excel.

There are two ways to calculate the SUM.

Adding cells
SUM function

-- Relative and Absolute References

Excel has two types of references:

Relative references
Absolute references

Absolute reference is a choice we make. It is a command which tells Excel to lock a reference.

The dollar sign ($) is used to make references absolute.

Example of relative reference: A1

Example of absolute reference: $A$1
The dollar sign has three different states:

Absolute for column and row. The reference is absolutely locked.
Example =$A$1

Absolute for the column. The reference is locked to that column. The row remains relative.
Example =$A1

Absolute for the row. The reference is locked to that row. The column remains relative.
Example =A$1

-- EXCEL ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
ADDITION
SUBSTACTION
MULTIPLICATION
DIVISION

-- Parentheses
Using parentheses makes Excel do the calculation for the numbers inside the parentheses first, before calculating the rest of the formula.

Parentheses are added by typing () on both sides of numbers, like (1+2).

-- EXCEL FORMATTING:
Formatting is used to make spreadsheets more readable. There are many ways to add styles. The most common ones are; Color, Font, Number format and Grids.


Hexadecimal Colors
Excel supports Hexadecimal color values

A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB.

RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and FF specifying the intensity of the color.

Font Name
The default font in Excel is Calibri.

The font name can be changed for both numbers and text.

Why change the font name in Excel?

Make the data easier to read
Make the presentation more appeaL

Fonts can be changed in four different ways: color, font name, size and other characteristics. The fonts are changed to make the spreadsheet more readable and delicate.


Number Formats
The default Number format is General.

Why change number formats?

Make data explainable
Prepare data for functions, so that Excel understands what kind of data you are working with.
Examples of number formats:

General
Number
Currency
Time

Grids
By default, gridlines are displayed in Excel.

However, grids can be removed.

Why remove grids?

Make the spreadsheet more readable
Make the spreadsheet more delicate

EXCEL DATA ANALYSIS:

Excel Sorting
Ranges can be sorted using the Sort Ascending and Sort Descending commands.

When sorting multiple columns, it will always sort by the first column (leftmost).

-- Excel Filter
Filters can be applied to sort and hide data. It makes data analysis easier.

-- Table Design
Tables can be customized and styled in a few clicks.

Converting a range into a table gives access to a menu called "Table Design".

-- Table Resizing
The size of a table can be changed.

Resizing is to increase or decrease the range of the table.

There are three ways to resize a table

Resize table command
Drag to resize
Adding headers

-- Removing duplicates are helpful when cleaning a dataset and you do not want to include copies.

-- Table Style
Excel has many ready to use styles which can be applied for tables.

Table styles is to change the appearance of the table.

It can be changed to:

Make it easier to read and understand
Make it look better
The table style is Blue, Table Style Medium 2 by default.

-- Conditional Formatting
Conditional formatting is used to change the appearance of cells in a range based on your specified conditions.

The conditions are rules based on specified numerical values or matching text.

-- HCR: HIGHLIGHT CELL RULE
Duplicate Values.. is one of the options for the condition, and can check for both duplicate and unique values.

EXCEL BAR;
COLOR SCALE;
ICON SET;
MANAGE RULE;

Excel Charts
Charts are visual representations of data used to make it more understandable.

Commonly used charts are:

Pie chart
Column chart
Line chart
